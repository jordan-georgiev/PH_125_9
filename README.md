# MovieLens Project Submission for HarvardX PH125.9x

The Movielens project is part of the HarvardX PH125.9x Capstone course.

The goal of this project is to create a recommendation system for movies based on the 10M version of the MovieLens dataset. A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system that suggests relevant items to users based on their preferences, interests, and past behavior. These systems are commonly used in various online platforms, such as e-commerce websites, streaming services, social media, and news sites, to enhance user experience and increase engagement. The system tries to predict a recommendation or rating a user would give to a product (articles, books, movies etc.) by using machine learning algorithms. The predicted rating can then be used to recommend additional products to the user.

Our goal is to develop and train a machine learning model capable of predicting the ratings a user would provide for a movie in a designated validation set. This model will be trained on a dataset containing historical ratings from a set of users for various movies. In order to evaluate the performance of our model we will use the loss function RMSE (root mean squared error) while aiming at a value of RMSE \< 0.86490. The final RMSE score of the developed model was 0.8648545.
